# OSCARSListener

Simple HTTP service that translates JSON requests to OSCARS API

## Why? 
In the summer of 2013, I worked with the integration of [OSCARS](http://www.es.net/services/virtual-circuits-oscars/ OSCARS) and [Floodlight](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/). In the SDN context, OSCARS is an application that controls the [ESnet](http://es.net/) 100G network and Floodlight is a SDN controller that communicates with network devices using [OpenFlow](http://www.openflow.org/). 

This repository has the code for OSCARSListener: a simple HTTP service that enables an external application to request OSCARS circuits using JSON. This code is based on the code found at the [OSCARS API wiki page](https://code.google.com/p/oscars-idc/wiki/OSCARS_Java_Client_API).

## Usage

#### OSCARS Installation
The first thing you need to do is, not surprisingly, to install OSCARS. Follow instructions on the [OSCARS Repository](http://github.com/hsr/oscars) to install OSCARS. 

#### Setup Keys

Generate your keys using the alias `client` and password `client` (if you decide to use different alias and password, you need to change that in the code as well):

    keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa -alias client -keystore oscars-cert.jks

After creating your keystore, extract the certificate from it and copy the certificate to your server running OSCARS:

    keytool -export -keystore ./oscar-cert.jks -file oscars-client.cer -alias client
    scp oscars-client.cer ${YOUR_SERVER}:~/

On your server, import the certificate to each keystore created after the OSCARS installation:

    cd ${OSCARS_HOME}/sampleDomain/certs/
    keytool -import -file oscars-client.cer -alias client -keystore {client,localhost,oscarsidc,service,truststore}.jks

The default password for OSCARS's keystores is `changeit`

Create a user using OSCARS web interface. You'll need the X509 subject and issuer name of your certificate. Â You can get it after importing your certificate to one of the OSCARS keystores. It looks  like: 

"Owner: CN=client client, OU=net, O=esnet, L=berkeley, ST=ca, C=us"

Now extract the OSCARS server certificates that will be imported on your client. In my case I imported theca and thera. You might need other certificates depending on your setup:

    keytool -list -keystore oscarsidc.jks
    keytool -export -keystore oscarsidc.jks -alias theca -file theca.cer
    keytool -export -keystore oscarsidc.jks -alias thera -file thera.cer

Copy the certificates to your client:

    scp {theca,thera}.cer ${YOUR_CLIENT}:~/${KEYS_PATH}/

And import them to your keystore:

    keytool -import -keystore oscars-cert.jks -file ${KEYS_PATH}/theca.cer -alias theca
    keytool -import -keystore oscars-cert.jks -file ${KEYS_PATH}/theca.cer -alias thera
    
#### Run service:

The parameters for OSCARSListener are:

 - Port that OSCARSListener should listen for JSON requests.
 - OSCARS server URL (without port).
 - OSCARS domain that will be included in the requests.
 - OSCARS directory/path where your keystore is.

Start the service:

    PORT=9911
    DOMAIN="testdomain-1"
    java -jar oscars-listener.jar ${PORT} ${YOUR_SERVER} ${DOMAIN} ${KEYS_PATH}
    

#### Examples:

**List all finished circuits:**

    curl http://${YOUR_SERVER}:${PORT}/list/finished
    
**List all active circuits:**

    curl http://${YOUR_SERVER}:${PORT}/list/active

**Request a reservation from node N1 port N1P1 to node N2 port N2P1 of 100mbps:**

    curl -d '{"bandwidth":100000000,"src-switch":"N1","src-port":"N1P1","dst-switch":"N2","dst-port":"N2P1","ofrule":"nop"}' http://${YOUR_SERVER}:${PORT}/request 

**Request the same reservation, but to carry only UDP traffic (only with SDNPSS - replace node names with DPID):**

    curl -d '{"bandwidth":100000000,"src-switch":"N1","src-port":"N1P1","dst-switch":"N2","dst-port":"N2P1","ofrule":"nw_proto=17"}' http://${YOUR_SERVER}:${PORT}/request 

### Known issues

**Time out of sync:** If you get a message like "Error returned from server: The message has expired (WSSecurityEngine: Invalid timestamp The security semantics of the message have expired)", make sure that your server's clock is accurate. If not, adjust it manually or using NTP.
